   In other words, you can use your Home directory in read/write mode and
   your data will be stored on your external non-volatile removable device.

  - Just have a previously formatted USB external disk (like a flash pen).
  - A blank file called "xsistence-mode" on the root of the USB storage above.
  - Some free space on it, at least 15 Mb.
  - Add "xsistence" boot option to enable it.
    - If the System detects a previously created image file, it will use that.
    - If the System does not detect an XsistenCe image, it will be created.
      - You can specify the size (MB) of it, by adding: "xsistence_mb=xxx"
